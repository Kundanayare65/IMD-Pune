Exploring Heavy Rainfall Patterns through K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on analyzing heavy rainfall events in India during 2019 using advanced unsupervised machine learning techniques, particularly K-Means clustering. The project was undertaken as part of an internship at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune, under the guidance of Dr. Rajib Chattopadhyay.

Key Features
Dataset: High-resolution (0.25° × 0.25°) gridded rainfall data provided by IMD, covering events with rainfall between 64 mm and 114 mm.
Clustering: Utilized K-Means clustering to group rainfall data into six distinct patterns based on temporal and spatial variations.
Visualization: Choropleth maps, histograms, and line plots to illustrate cluster-specific rainfall trends and flood risks.
Insights: Identified regions with increased flood susceptibility and proposed targeted mitigation strategies, including levees and improved drainage systems.
Technologies Used
Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn) for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
Visualization: Geographic and statistical plots for detailed analysis.
Impact
The project emphasizes the importance of integrating machine learning with climatology to enhance disaster preparedness and climate change mitigation. It provides actionable insights for policymakers and environmentalists to address the challenges posed by extreme weather events.
